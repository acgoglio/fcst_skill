TO CREATE THE FILES WITH THE INFO OF THE GRIDS FOR THE INTERPOLATION WITH CDO (FOR SST)
- mygrid_24deg is the file with the info of the starting grid 1/24
  a) select an output NEMO file _T of EAS5 es: mfs_eas5-20200825-20200825-f-T.nc
  b) cdo griddes mfs_eas5-20200825-20200825-f-T.nc > mygrid_24deg
- mygrid_16deg is the file with the info of the final grid 1/16
  a) select an output NEMO file _T of EAS1 es: mfs_efs1_20200909_20200909_s_T.nc
  b) python modify_netcdf_EAS1_CDO.py (change the absolute path at line 7) (From nav_lat of EAS1 to nav_lat of SST)
  c) cdo griddes mfs_efs1_20200909_20200909_s_T.nc > mygrid_16deg

mygrid_16deg and mygrid_24deg must be saved in the directory with the static files for the QVR.

Command to interpolate
cdo remapbil,mygrid_16deg -setgrid,mygrid_24deg infile outfile

TO CREATE THE MONTHLY FILE TO UPLOAD ON THE FTP SITE OF MOI:
- cd /your_path/{YorEnvironmentName}
- . setup.sh
- sh ./pack/or-validation/MED_QVR/QVR.dir/postprocQVR.sh YYYYMM01 YYYYMMDD
YYYYMM01 and YYYYMMDD are the first and the last date of the month to which the statistics refer

The output files of the previous script are:
- TEMP.nc
- product_quality_stats_MEDSEA-ANALYSISFORECAST-PHY-006-013_YYYYMM01_YYYYMMDD.nc

TO CHECK ALL THE STATISTICS (on Zeus or Juno):
bsub -n 1 -q s_long -J PLOTMVR -e /work/opa/mfs/aderr -o /work/opa/mfs/adout -P 0510 "python ./pack/or-validation/MED_QVR/QVR.dir/checkQVR.py dirin dirplotput YYYYMM01 YYYYMMDD NN"

dirin is the directory where there is the file TEMP.nc
dirplotput is the directory where the output plots are created
YYYYMM01 and YYYYMMDD are the first and the last date of the month to which the statistics refer
NN=0 if we want only the plots for the Med basin
NN=1 if we want the plots for the Med basin and for all the 16 subregions.
